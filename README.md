# NewMath-InfinityFramework

A conceptual and experimental Python framework that redefines core mathematical operations, including the previously undefined division by zero. This new math system proposes a consistent framework for working with "infinity" as a calculable entity, opening possibilities in advanced theory, AI, physics, and abstract computing.

nm = NewMath()

# Basic Infinity Logic
print(nm.divide(42, 0))  # "infinity"
print(nm.add(100, nm.infinity))  # "infinity"
print(nm.subtract(nm.infinity, nm.infinity))  # "Undefined"
print(nm.multiply(0, nm.infinity))  # 0
print(nm.exponentiate(nm.infinity, 0))  # 1

# 🧪 Exercise: Escape Velocity at the Event Horizon Using NewMath



## Scenario
You're modeling a black hole. According to classical physics, the escape velocity from a celestial object is given by:

$$ v = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}} $$

Where:
$$
-\( G \) = gravitational constant = \( 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2} \)
$$
- \( M \) = mass of the object (in kilograms)
- \( r \) = distance from the center of the object (in meters)

---

## 📘 Problem
Calculate the escape velocity at a radius \( r = 0 \) for a black hole with mass:

$$ M = 1.989 \times 10^{30} \text{ kg} $$

(This is the approximate mass of the Sun.)

---

## ✅ Classical Result:
$$ v = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{0}} = \sqrt{\infty} = \infty $$

This result is **undefined** in standard math, but in **NewMath**, we allow division by zero to result in `"infinity"`.

---

## 🧠 Solution Using NewMath (Python Code)

```python
from new_math import NewMath

nm = NewMath()

# Constants
G = 6.67430e-11  # Gravitational constant
M = 1.989e30     # Mass of the Sun in kg
r = 0            # Event horizon at r = 0

# Using NewMath to model escape velocity
numerator = 2 * G * M
escape_velocity = nm.divide(numerator, r)

print("Escape velocity at r = 0 is:", escape_velocity)

```
## 💻 Expected Output:

~~~
Escape velocity at r = 0 is: infinity
~~~
## ⏳ 1. Time Travel Paradox

### 🔁 Problem:
What happens when you divide time by zero?


$$
\Delta t = \frac{1}{0}

### ✅ NewMath Interpretation:
Time collapses to a single point — representing:

- Time loop
- Time reset

### 💻 Code Example:
```python
from new_math import NewMath
nm = NewMath()
time_jump = nm.divide(1, 0)
print("Time collapse event:", time_jump)

```
