# NewMath-InfinityFramework
A conceptual and experimental Python framework exploring an alternative mathematical system that defines division by zero and interactions with infinity in a consistent way.

# NewMath-InfinityFramework

A conceptual and experimental Python framework that redefines core mathematical operations, including the previously undefined division by zero. This new math system proposes a consistent framework for working with "infinity" as a calculable entity, opening possibilities in advanced theory, AI, physics, and abstract computing.

## ✨ Key Features

✅ Division by zero is defined to return a special value: `∞`
✅ Adds new rules for interactions with `∞`, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation
✅ Handles edge cases like `∞ - ∞`, `0 * ∞`, and `∞^0`
✅ Custom `solve_equation()` parser for extended evaluations
✅ Realistic model of extended math used for theoretical and practical modeling
✅ Fully open-source under the MIT license

## 🚀 Example Usage
```python
from new_math import NewMath

nm = NewMath()

print(nm.divide(42, 0))  # ∞
print(nm.add(100, nm.infinity))  # ∞
print(nm.subtract(nm.infinity, nm.infinity))  # "Undefined"
print(nm.multiply(0, nm.infinity))  # 0
print(nm.exponentiate(nm.infinity, 0))  # 1
print(nm.solve_equation("10 / 0 + 5"))  # ∞
```

## 🤝 Contributing
This project is open to contributions. Fork the repo, open a pull request, or start a discussion under Issues. Let’s explore what happens when we change the rules of math.

## 🌌 Why This Project Matters
By redefining one of the most forbidden operations in classical math (division by zero), we open a gateway to a new interpretation of logic, physics, and computer science. This framework is a playground for experimentation and innovation.
